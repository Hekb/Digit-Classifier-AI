# MNIST Hand Written Digit Classifer
Back propagation feed neural network that classifies hand written digits in C++ with a sucess of 90%>

# Class Project for CSCI:360 at USC 

**Description** <br>
Task1: Simple perceptron that learns XOR table <br>
Task2: Used for analysis with different hyperparamters <br>
Task3: Back propagation feed neural network <br>

**How to Run Task3**
- `cd task3`
- `./task3`

**Output for task3**
- First part is training the date with sigmoid activation function <br>
It will take 15 epochs to train the model then it will produce the success validation results after training

- Second part is using a different activation function which is tanh.
